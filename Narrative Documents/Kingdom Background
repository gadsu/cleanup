Kingdom: Katharis

Slimes were adopted as pets due to their cute and harmless nature until they grew out of control and slimified the Kingdom.

Possible reasons for Slimes betraying:
•	Slimes were tired of the attention and cuddles (Like Cats)
•	Mistreated as mere objects of cuteness
Multiplied to rapidly with no way to cull their numbers, (No natural preditor?)
