	Long ago, when the kingdom of Katharis was formed, it was a small and dirty nation.
Due to all of the filth around the kingdom, people kept falling ill, some of which grew to deadly proportions.
This is when the king decreed that all of the filth shall start being cleaned up, so as to prevent more sickness and death.
From that point on, the kingdom of Katharis started to take pride in how clean it was, and always made sure to be the cleanest nation.
With the recent discovery of the adorable slimes, people have taken to adopting them as pets in Katharis.
When the slimes suddenly turned on the denizens and covered the whole kingdom in goop.
