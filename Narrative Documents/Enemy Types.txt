Slime Enemies:
- Base Red: Average Speed
- Base Green: Slow Speed
- Base Blue: Fast Speed

Possible Enemies:
- Goop Mother: Spawns the base slimes, and also shares speed/color with the slimes it spawns

Not sure what else should go in here, I just know we were talking about having different enemy types so figured there should be a document for it. Will try to keep this updated as we get more ideas nailed down.
