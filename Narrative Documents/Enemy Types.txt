Slime Enemies:
- Red Goopa: Average Speed
- Green Goopa: Slow Speed
- Blue Goopa: Fast Speed

Possible Enemies:
- Goop Mother: Spawns the Goopas, and also shares speed/color with the Goopas it spawns

Not sure what else should go in here, I just know we were talking about having different enemy types so figured there should be a document for it. Will try to keep this updated as we get more ideas nailed down.
