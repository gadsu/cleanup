- possible idea for slime tools
(flat wall with npc at the base stuck in slime)
*upon cleaning/freeing the npc*
Show button being pressed (need a button to activate tools?) see green slime gloves get equipped and see MC climb the wall
or
show MC walk to wall, green slime gloves get equipped, and MC climbs wall

(gap with npc slimed in front of it)
*upon cleaning/freeing the npc*
Show button being pressed (if we decide to have one), see blue slime boots get equipped and see MC speeding down hill and jumping the gap (think this is probably best way to go about it for the boots being there doesnt seem to be something that can just auto proc the boots like the wall could proc the gloves)
