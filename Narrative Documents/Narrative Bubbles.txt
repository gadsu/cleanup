Narrative Bubbles: 

Tutorial Thought bubbles:
(some of the quotes are gonna be WIP for the time being)

*upon starting level*
Shows MC move with the wasd buttons being pushed (or analog stick being tilted) while he moves in the respective directions
"Time to get moving, this kingdom is filthy."

*upon getting to the old man*
Show MC walking up to NPC with the y button being pressed and some example dialouge showing up
"Maybe I can use *insert button here* to talk to this old man."

*upon picking up mop*
Shows picture of a sparkling kingdom. But then bucket with a quesion mark.
"Finally, a mop, now all I need is a bucket and I can get to work cleaning up this mess."

*Upon seeing slime on the ground for the first time*
Displays an image of the mop mopping up the slime with the y button being pressed.
"I wonder if *insert button here* will allow me to clean this up too."

*upon seeing a slime for the first time*
Stops game to display the bubble
shows MC 'cleaning' the slime with the mop with the x button being pressed
"Oh great, I have to wash away living slimes too? What happened to all of our knights?"

--*upon seeing slime on the wall for the first time*
--Shows MC stuck to wall before jumping off of the wall
(Needs to be changed)

*upon picking up the bucket*
Thumbs up with a picture of sparkling kingdom.(Mabye a picture of the MC giving the thumbs up on a clean kingdom. -Ian)
"A bucket! I'll have this place clean in no time now!"

--*At the last obstacle of tutorial level*
--Display bubble showing the slime being thrown onto the surface of the map, also --displaying the buttons needed to do so. (LT and B)
(Think this was for the last steep slope in the level, need to think of something new)
(Mabye a vertical wall with the suggestion Tyler had earlier? LT and RT swap equptment and B activates? That would be good for the shoes and Red Slime. -Ian)

- possible idea for slime tools
(flat wall with npc at the base stuck in slime)
*upon cleaning/freeing the npc*
Show button being pressed (need a button to activate tools?) see green slime gloves get equipped and see MC climb the wall. (Similar to rock climbing.)
or
show MC walk to wall, green slime gloves get equipped, and MC climbs wall
NPC: "Thanks for freeing me. Hopefully these gloves will keep your hands from getting dirty."

(gap with npc slimed in front of it)
*upon cleaning/freeing the npc*
Show button being pressed (if we decide to have one), see blue slime boots get equipped and see MC speeding down hill and jumping the gap (think this is probably best way to go about it for the boots being there doesnt seem to be something that can just auto proc the boots like the wall could proc the gloves).
(It could be similar to the heavy metal boots in zelda but the opposite. Once the B button is pressed the player's movement speed increases and leaves behind a trail of blue slime that, could disappear after 1 minute or 1 minute 30 seconds. B Deactivates the boots again so the player can push rocks and such onto the blue slime. -Ian)
NPC: "Finally, I can move again. Take these shoes in case yours get too dirty."
