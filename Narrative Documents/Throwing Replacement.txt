Scraping of the throwing mechanic
Green gloves for the wall climbing, still saps from gauge so once youre out you cant climb walls and need to refill
Blue boots that also sap from the gauge, need to keep track to move faster, refill once your out
Red block can only be dispensed right in front of you, also saps from gauge, need to refill once empty to make more.
