Slimes and Their Abilities:

Green slimes are the first enemies you will encounter. They do what slimes do best; make things sticky. Without knowing how to use it the slime may seem like a hinderence. It slows you down, makes things so you cant push them, and makes jumping harder. Used correctly however, you can use it to slow down enemies, or use it to jump off walls if you need some extra height.
