How to Play:

In Kingdom Clean-Up, your home has been taken over by the cute, cuddly slimes. The goal of the game?

Slimes and Their Abilities:

Green slimes are the first enemies you will encounter. They do what slimes do best; make things sticky. Without knowing how to use it the slime may seem like a hinderence. It slows you down, makes things so you cant push them, and makes jumping harder. With the Green Slime Gloves however, you can scale vertical walls.
