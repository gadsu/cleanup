   * Most, if not all, bosses will have 9 hitpoints. Every 3 attacks the boss will do a powerful move that the player must avoid.


Bosses
* OBSOOOTM (1 heart damage output across the board)
   * Aggressive Goopa stuck in a bucket, Big attack is a large jump followed by a slam into the player.
   * Big attack happens every few seconds, or every few jumps
   * Special attack consists of consecutive jumps across the arena, the player must avoid by running beneath OBSOOO between each jump.
   * Special attacked triggered by Obsooo taking 3 damage

* Barney (Slime balls deal half heart of damage, Slime lazer deals 1 1/2 hearts of damage, Flailing tentacles deal 1 heart damage)
   * Large Spider like slime that hangs from the ceiling
   * Throws slime balls at the player that hurts and slows upon hitting the player
   * After three hits he throws a large amount of slime over the half of the stage that will hurt the player and is too thick to clean (supposed to cover most of that half of the stage, but leave the bottom area open for final stage)
   * The special attack originates from Barney, starts at the top of the screen and moves down leaving time for the player to get out of the way. (Doesn't go all the way to the bottom, Stops about the bottom of the bottom left/right platforms.)
   * After both sides of the stage have been covered (6 hits) the boss will fall to the ground swinging its arms/tentacles around which deals damage to the player if the player gets hit

*(Possible Third Boss names: Goobert, Goory, Blobert, Goopy, Squishy, Blobby, Goomi, Goomy)
