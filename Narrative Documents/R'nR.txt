Ideas made on 11/29:
Rock 'n Roll (temp name)
- Armadillo like
- Rocks for armored shell
- Rolls at player as basic attack (1 heart of damage)
- Supposed to use blue slime to make it roll into the water which damages it
	- As R'nR climbs out of the water, blue slime with splash onto the sides of the stage to provide players more blue slime if they need it
- Special attack (triggers after 3 damage)
	- R'nR rolls in place causing rocks to fly off dealing 1/2 heart of damage to the player per hit
- "Stance" change (triggers after 6 damage and the 2nd special attack)
	- R'nR now has less rocks which allows him to charge a little faster (deals 1 heart of damage if hit)
	- R'nR no longer runs off of the stage, but is now hitable with the mop

Ideas made on 11/30 while talking with Nick:
- Mixture of hardened slime and rocks are what make up the shell
- incorportate potential period of no movement that would allow you to chip rocks off of R'nR
	- This could work in place or alongside rocks falling off as R'nR falls in water
