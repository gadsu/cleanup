1.	To fix the animator bug you have to add a child Empty GameObject to any game object with a rigid body that needs to be animated 

2.	Put your sprite renderer and Animator on the child gameObject

3.	make sure to reference your animator and sprite renderer with GetComponetInChildren<>

4.	If you do this to a Prefab it will break and have to be re added to the prefabs folder and any script that was refrenceing the prefab I.E. Spawners

Ex 1)  an = GetComponentInChildren<Animator>();

Ex 2) GetComponentInChildren<SpriteRenderer>().color = cgreen;
