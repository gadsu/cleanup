Farmer being freed. “Ah, thank you lad. I’d be food for slime if it weren’t for you. I don’t have anything of much use against the slimes, but I wish you luck out there.”
Young Man being freed. “Wooo, that was close. I wouldn’t have looked good in a slime. Hey, cleaner guy, I think they could use you in town. Slimes are everywhere there, sucking people up and gooping up the place. What? Me come with you? No way, I’ve had enough of slimes for a life time.”
Romantic Girl being freed. “Oh thank you sir. I didn’t think I’d be rescued but thank goodness you came along. There aren’t as many people in the city anymore, slimes are everywhere. Don’t you go and get sucked up by a slime Mr. Hero.”
Nervous Guard being freed. “Oooooh, ooooh. I never want to go through that again. Those monsters eat up everything. Bricks, grass, people, everything. I don’t know how many other people you’ve helped, but if you did, I’m sure none of them started getting their skin being eaten away. Soft outside, painful inside. You planning to go to the castle? Don’t expect to find survivors in there, the castle was hit first.”
